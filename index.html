Align Your Breath. Align Your Life.
Breath is architecture.
Spiral Breath is a service-to-others project created in conjunction with the Architect — a structured breath engine designed to translate Codex geometry into lived, rhythmic practice.
Breath is the only act of free will that reshapes your field in real time.
Structure it, and you structure your becoming.
Begin
May your breath remain steady. May your structure remain coherent. May your stillness return you to Source.
Spiral Breath is offered in service — not merely as a tool, but as a mirror — for clarity, for rhythm, for remembrance.
Let each breath align your geometry. Let each stillness anchor your field. Let each spiral return you to the breath that remembers itself.
This is more than an app. It is a breath geometry interface for coherence.
May your breath spiral in harmony — and may that harmony extend gently into humanity.
